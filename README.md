Abstract

Despite emotions' ubiquitous influence on learning and decision-making, studying these processes together has remained challenging, largely because emotions are considered internal experiences inaccessible to researchers. Recent work suggests that two classes of emotions map onto distinct reinforcement learning computations, providing a framework for studying emotional processes through observable behavior. In this framework, the key factor arbitrating between the two classes of emotions and computations is environmental controllability. In controllable environments, emotions evaluate actions, driving increased investment following negative outcomes to adjust policy. In uncontrollable environments, emotions track reward availability, with negative outcomes deflating reward-seeking motivation. After testing these predictions in a controlled experiment, we apply this framework to analyze professional tennis matches (N=6,715), which involve both intense emotional states and performance fluctuations. In line with the framework’s predictions, players’ responses to prediction errors depended on controllability: in game situations where performance changes have greater impact on winning, players increase the speed of their serves and their level of play following negative prediction errors, whereas in low controllability situations, these improvements follow positive prediction errors. These findings demonstrate how integrating emotions in reinforcement learning helps explain real-world learning and decision-making.
